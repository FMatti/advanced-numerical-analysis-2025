# Advanced Numerical Analysis I MATH-250

## Schedule
- Lectures: Thursday, 14h15 - 16h00, CE 1 5
- Exercises: Friday, 10h15 - 12h00, CO 020 (last names A - F) and CO 021 (last names G - Z)

## Graded exercises
Each week we will ask you to submit your solution to one of the exercises on the exercise sheet. These exercises will be graded, and will count as a bonus towards your final grade. The submission happens through Moodle and the deadline will be indicated on the exercise sheet.

## Implementation exercises
Some of the exercises will require you to write Python code. We will provide you with Jupyter Notebooks, in which you can solve the exercises. You can edit these notebooks in any Python editor you may already be familiar with (VSCode, PyCharm, Spyder, Jupyter lab...). If you do not know how to install a Jupyter notebooks editor, refer to the instructions page you can find below. You can either download the notebooks or edit them directly on EPFL's Noto server at go.epfl.ch/advanced-numerical-analysis-2025.
